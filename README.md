# Quantum_Tunneling

Quantum particles and light can tunnel through barriers which can not be penetrated by classical particles. 
Importantly, the time it takes quantum particles to do this is contentious.

In this project, we used a top hat potential (also known as a rectangular potential barrier) and calculated its eigenfunctions analytically.

Using these eigenfunctions, we can expanded the bump and study its progress through the barrier both numerically and analytically. 

The analytical answer is shown in LATEX PDF, whereas the numerical answer is in MATLAB code.
